# Gsoc2016
My project for Google Summer of Code 2016.

## Week 1
Started work on [ParallelGraphs.jl](https://github.com/pranavtbhat/ParallelGraphs.jl). I'm going to try to develop a basic graph datastrucutre that use the N-Dimensional Sparse matrix data structure provided by [NDSparse.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/NDSparseData.jl).
